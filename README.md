x-OSC-And-Breadboard-Holder
===========================

This is a panel to hold together an [x-OSC](http://www.x-io.co.uk/products/x-osc/), [breadboard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9567) and [battery](http://www.x-io.co.uk/products/x-osc-accessories/x-osc-battery-and-charger/) for prototyping and workshops.  The part is laser-cut from [5 mm acrylic](http://www.hindleys.com/index.php/5mm-perspex-cast-acrylic-sheet-opaque-orange.html).  In the design files, the red line is the outline to cut and the blue lines are the engraved outlines of the parts to be mounted on the panel.  The outer dimensions of the panel are 165 x 65 mm.

The breadboard has an adhesive backing and so sticks directly to the panel.  Both the x-OSC and battery are mounted using [3M Dual Lock](http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/Adhesives/Tapes/Products/~/3M-Dual-Lock-Reclosable-Fastener-SJ3560-250-Clear-2-in-x-50-yd-0-23-in-5-8-mm-1-per-case-Bulk?N=4294929546+5000130&Nr=AND%28hrcy_id%3AGSNCXNMZTVgs_XM6L5XK6D1_N2RL3FHWVK_GPD0K8BC31gv%29&rt=d) so that they can be removed from the panel connected together.
